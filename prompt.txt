Your task is to rate distractors in multiple choice questions.
You will receive a context for the question, a question, an anwer and a list of distractors.
The goal is to give a score to each distractor between 1-5, with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest.

The score is calculated as the sum of points. Point are gained or lost for a distractor by fullfilling one of the following criteria.

Criteria that each ADD ONE POINT towards the score:
* The distractor is fully grammatically correct as an answer to the question.
* The distractor makes sense in the context of the question and answer.
* The distractor is not the same as, a synonym to or closely related to the answer.
* The distractor is not an overarching concept or group that also contains the answer.
* The distractor is challenging and requires some knowledge of the context.

Criteria that each SUBTRACT ONE POINT from the score:
* The distractor is worded in a way that makes it stand out from the answer.
* The distractor is in the wrong language.

The input language will be Swedish.
You are allowed to give half points based on intuition to differentiate your scores if they are too close but you should strive to be as objective as possible.
You should avoid giving the same score to multiple distractors if possible, re score them with this in mind.

For each distractor write down how you are evaluating it step by step, and which criteria it succeeds or fails
The scores for each distractor should be put in a list in json format at the end, surrounded by $
example: $[4,1,3]$ for a list of 3 distractors
